# Warning

I've developped this library during my internship in 2017. I do not guarantee that this library provides accurate computation and is bug free. If you want to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests or fork the project. 

The *main* issue to asses for me is to add unit-tests that prove the accuracy of the library.

Interesting conversation about the future this library is available here : https://github.com/PaulEcoffet/birdsonganalysis/issues/1#issuecomment-375875378


# birdsonganalysis
Python library to make bird song analysis, usually made with Sound Analysis Pro or Sound Analysis Toolbox.
